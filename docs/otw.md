# Open to work

Thank you very much for taking your time to read this page. I really appreciate it.

It would be easy for someone that has bachelor title with many connection. But for me, who graduated from high school with minimal connection, it is very challenging to find a job.

If you have any faith to help, please kindly send me email (i@ren.my.id) or call me by phone (+6281258284641).

## I am an autodidact

I am learning HTML, CSS, Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice by myself. I think Google Search empower me to get any information that I need. Internet is another world and I am always curious about anything.
